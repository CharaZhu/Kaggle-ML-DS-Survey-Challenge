# Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge

Kaggle has hosted an open data scientist competition in 2020 titled “Kaggle ML & DS Survey
Challenge.” The purpose of this challenge was to “tell a data story about a subset of the data science
community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.”

More information on the competition, data, and prizes can be found on: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data

The dataset provided (kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv) contains the survey results provided by
Kaggle. The survey results from 20036 participants are shown in 355 columns, representing survey
